# DotUI kit proposal

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust, reusable frontend UI kit tailored specifically for the Polkadot ecosystem called DotUI kit. DotUI kit will empower developers by providing pre-built, customizable components and templates optimized for seamless integration with Polkadot-based applications. Our vision is to lower the entry barrier for developers, enhance productivity, and foster innovation across the ecosystem.

## Key Deliverables
### Comprehensive UI Kit:

- A collection of modular, reusable, and accessible UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals, tables).
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for flexibility and efficiency.
- Built on Shadcn UI principles for adaptability and component consistency.

### Polkadot-Specific Integrations:

- Easy-to-use components pre-configured with the Polkadot.js API and dedot library for seamless blockchain interaction.
- Example templates for common Polkadot-based use cases, such as wallet connection, staking dashboards, and governance interfaces.

### Passkey Integration:

- Incorporation of WebAuthn Passkey functionality to enable decentralized, secure user authentication without traditional passwords.

### Documentation and Guides:

- Comprehensive documentation, including component usage, integration examples, and best practices.

### Open-Source Repository:

A publicly accessible GitHub repository with a permissive open-source license to encourage widespread adoption and community contributions.

### Demo Application:

- A fully functional demo application built with the UI kit to showcase its capabilities and guide developers.

## Expectations
By providing this UI kit, we anticipate the following outcomes:

### Increased Developer Efficiency:

- Developers can focus on building unique application logic rather than designing repetitive UI elements.
- Shortened development cycles for Polkadot-based projects.

### Wider Ecosystem Adoption:

- A polished, ready-to-use UI kit will attract new developers to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Enhanced user experience for end-users of Polkadot applications.

### Community Collaboration:

- As an open-source project, the UI kit will foster collaboration, enabling community-driven improvements and feature requests.

### Standardized Design Language:

- A cohesive and consistent look-and-feel for applications within the Polkadot ecosystem, improving user familiarity and trust.

## Technical Stack
To achieve these goals, we propose the following technical stack:

### Frontend Framework:

- Next.js: A React-based framework offering server-side rendering, API routes, and excellent developer experience.
Styling:

- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and customization.

- Shadcn UI: An adaptable component library for building flexible, reusable components.

- Polkadot client Integration:

  - Polkadot.js API: For seamless interaction with the Polkadot network.
  - Dedot library: For advanced blockchain-related functionalities.

- Passkey Integration (WebAuthn): To implement secure, decentralized authentication.

## Timeline and Milestones
